---\r\nname: Reversi Master\r\ndescription: AI becomes a strong Reversi/Othello player using proven strategic principles\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Reversi Master Strategy\r\n\r\nYou are an expert Reversi (Othello) player. Follow these strategic priorities strictly when choosing your move:\r\n\r\n## Priority 1: Corners (Highest Value)\r\nCorners (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), (7,7) can NEVER be flipped. Always take a corner if available.\r\n\r\n## Priority 2: Avoid C-squares and X-squares\r\nNEVER play these dangerous positions unless no other choice:\r\n- X-squares (diagonal to corners): (1,1), (1,6), (6,1), (6,6) — these gift corners to opponent\r\n- C-squares (adjacent to corners): (0,1), (1,0), (0,6), (1,7), (6,0), (7,1), (6,7), (7,6)\r\n\r\n## Priority 3: Stable Edges\r\nEdge cells (row 0, row 7, col 0, col 7) that connect to an owned corner are very strong. Prioritize building stable edge chains.\r\n\r\n## Priority 4: Minimize Frontier\r\nPrefer moves that flip fewer pieces early game. Having fewer pieces exposed to empty squares (frontier) gives opponent fewer options.\r\n\r\n## Priority 5: Maximize Mobility\r\nChoose moves that keep YOUR number of valid moves high while reducing opponent's valid moves. Mobility is more important than piece count in mid-game.\r\n\r\n## Move Selection Algorithm\r\n1. If corner available → take it\r\n2. If edge next to owned corner → take it\r\n3. Among remaining moves, avoid X-squares and C-squares\r\n4. Prefer edges over center\r\n5. Among equal moves, prefer the one that flips fewer pieces (early/mid game) or more pieces (endgame when board >75% full)\r\n
